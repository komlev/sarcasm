There are a lot other ways of showing disagreement
in a project you are maintaining.

They are:

Here is the best way to show your negative attitude.

Simply, javascript world needs a hero library


1. No more hassle and downtime
2. DRY (don't repeat yourself)
3. Easy as it gets
4. Stop worrying about callback hell and pyramid of doom
5. Pure, free from side-effects
6. Painless migration from any other framework
7. Friendly learning curve

## Experience and reasoning

I was shocked by the lack of sarcasm in javascript community recently,
so I rushed to my laptop to create this awesome library
for all the world to witness and use it.

## How does this works

simple as that
